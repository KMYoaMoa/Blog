## A Brief Introduction

Generally speaking, it is true that Chinese don't like Japan.

But, if we want a deeper insight in the attitudes of Chinese toward Japan, it would become a super complex problem.

The history of World War II, Cold War and the competition between China and U.S. all influences the 中日関係.

Besides, the difference groups of people, the different generations of people, the government and the civil, all hold different attitudes.

Further more, in different context, the concept of 'Japan' or 'Japanese' may also differs. This also lead to the chaos of the impression of Chinese attitudes.

This article will explain in detail that what are the true attitudes and where do they come from. However, it's all based on my POV and my own experience, so it may not be objective enough.

## The Origins

### 第二次世界大戦

The history of W.W.II does not only cause the opposive emotions of Chinese but many Asian countries such as Korea. I don't mean to hurt anyone's heart but the Japanese Army does have done a big crime to these Asian countries, leaving many long term effects and pains.

That's why many Japanese are shameful for what they have done and even acknowledge that Japan deserve the 2 Nuclear Bombs. I won't put this topic in details, but Chinese hate Japanese for a reason.
### 靖国神社

In the Asian countries, 靖国神社 is a symbol representing the attitude that Japanese refuse to admit their mistakes and the 軍国主義 is still alive in Japan. Sadly, it might be the truth.

That's why every time a public person visits the 靖国神社, he/she will be attacked on the Chinese Social Media. And months ago, the man called '铁头惩恶扬善' drew the words on the 靖国神社.

Although many would think what he did is too extreme, but deep in the hearts, we kind of approve it.

### 中国民族主義

中国民族主義 is developed throughout the long history of China. We regards ourselves as the most civilized nation in the world, and the other nations are regarded as '东夷 南蛮 北狄 西戎' in four directions.

Many think that Japan learnt 漢字 and 文化 from China in the 唐-Dynasty, but it invaded us in return. So the 大和民族 is a total '破廉恥' nation. Some would regard Japan as a small 保護国 of 中華帝国 in the history and should have been ruled by China.

Although we are educated to treat all the nations in the world equally, this sense of pride of our nation are still approved in our culture. Especially when the 国力 has been rapidly recovering nowadays, regarded as '中華民族偉大復興'.

## The Abroad Factors
### Intro

Every phenomenon has complex reasons beneath and every reason has more fundamental reasons. If you keep finding these more fundamental reasons, you will find that they'll all come back to the U.S.

I don't mean to cheat anyone and change their believes to make them join the revolution or something else. But the truth is that the U.S. is now trying to control almost all parts of the world in economy, culture, politics, etc. both publicly and secretly.

That's why the U.S. is always an unavoidable power in almost all the phenomena in the international topics and events - 6th Middle East War, Russia-Ukraine War and East Asia, including 中日関係.

### Chinese Side

You may think the anti-Japanese Education is conducted by the Chinese Government. But our gov had never said things like 'Japanese are evil', or 'Beat down Japan'. We always use the expressions like 'Beat down the Japanese 軍国主義' and 'Beat down the Japanese 反動派'.

We regard the specific groups of people in the U.S. and Japan as evil and must be beaten down, but not all of them. Mao once said that the true enemy are not Japanese people, but Japanese 軍国主義, 米帝国主義 and the Chinese 反動派. Everyone who are on the people(人民)'s side and hope the world to be peaceful are friends, regardless of culture, nation.

This kind of 価値観 is unacceptable for the U.S. because it's threatening the cultural and mind control of the western capitalism democracy or '資本主義民主価値観' toward the East Asian countries.

So the CIA made use of the 中国民族主義 and the history problems and start to post the unfriendly words towards Japan like 'All Japanese should be killed' or something like that through robots, Taiwanese or Hongkong people on the internet and social media. This influences a lot of people emotionally, and the same thing happens in South Korea. (In North Korea it's another story.)

For those who are educated, these extreme 民族主義発言 is disgusting just as any normal person would feel. But for the majority, who are not having enough 判断力, it's gaining popularity.

That's also a part of reason why China establish the Great Fire Wall and developed a domestic Internet environment. It's kind of inconvinient for international communication (and find エロマンガ and AVs) but it's actually necessary in my opinion.

### Japan Side

For those who are farmiliar with history and politics, it is acknowledged that Japan is a 非正式植民地 of U.S. and has accept the 資本主義民主価値観. So you may born to be educated that China is a 独裁国家 and everyone hates Japan. And you might be aware that this impression is designed by U.S. and CIA after reading the contents above.

That's why many foreigners would change their impression after they have at least once been to China because the media is misleading your attitudes toward the Chinese People. Everything you see about Chinese are something like 'Chinese drive overspeed and killed a Japanese', 'Chinese is treating the 鹿 in 奈良公園 cruelly' and the unfriendly words twards Japanese on Social Media.

Maybe these are all the truth, but every 理智 Chinese would feel shameful for these things to happen. My parents would also show respect to the Japanese culture and try best to in Japan even if they are not very fond of Japan. I would also stop them speaking loudly on the street. But I have to admit that some wouldn't.

## The Generation Differences

Those who directly experienced the 中日戦争 are declining year by year. But their children, the generation of my grandfather, may still have a bad impression on the Japanese through the description of their parents and grand-parents.

And the impression of Japan of the generation of my parents became more abstract because the lack of international communication or cuntral exchange. They know that Japan once invaded our country but they grow up with the ドラえもん and some other Japanese Animation imported through Hongkong or Taiwan.

For those who born in 1990s can be big fans of Pokemon and ウルトラシリーズ like my step brothers. And for us born in 2000s can be as farmiliar to the Anime culture as Japanese. As you can see there are more and more Chinese and Korean staffs in the eds of Anime. Many Japanese style culture is now gaining popularity in China and Genshin, Arknights are typical Chinese Japanese-like Mobile Games.

But it doesn't mean that the memory of W.W.II has disappeard in the new generation. More and more people are learning about the deep reasons for the W.W.II and the bases for Japanese to start the 中日戦争, with the hope of making the people in two countries understand each other again. But it seems that there's still a long way to go.

## Conclusions

Generally speaking, it is true that Chinese don't like Japan. But more in detail, some Chinese don't like some specific aspects of Japan to different extends for different reasons.

Chinese would cheer for the Japanese soccer team because we are all human, having a family and a life, sharing the same hobby. It's unreasonable for us to hate these soccer team members. (Althouth some wouldn't think so.)

There might be a big barrier between China and Japan but a will to communicate and a spirit of understanding can break anything in the way.
